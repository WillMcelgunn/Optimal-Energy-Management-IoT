    "Welcome to Python! This first exercise of the IESS Project **Optimal Energy Management of a Smart Building** is designed to give you some first experience with Python or to refresh your knowledge. After the introduction of some simple, but necessary, concepts you will soon be working on your main task for this week: Creating a function that performs a polynomial regression. \n",

This should be self explanatory. Often there is more than one way of doing things and the tasks can be quite open. Feel free to do further investigations once you have finished the requirements. The filled out Notebooks should be sent to your supervisors after completion.\n",

There is no end statement or the like. The same is true for other Python structures like loops.\n",
